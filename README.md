The meta-models folder contains an Ecore CIM, PIM and PSM indivative implementation of the proposed REST-oriented meta-model, which has been used to conduct the experiment, while the RESTReviews folder contains the source code for the RESTReviews application before and after the modeling challenge. It also provides access to the generated CIM, PIM and PSM models for both cases.
